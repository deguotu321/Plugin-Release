Hey folks! Just finished polishing up the Reality Stabilizer plugin. Its main goal is to help out players who die early, giving them more opportunities to experience different roles and learn the map before the real chaos begins.

Core Concept: The Stabilization Phase

    At the start of every round, a random "Reality Stabilization" period begins.

    This phase lasts between 160 and 280 seconds (randomly chosen each round).

    During this time, death isn't permanent! Players who die will automatically respawn.
